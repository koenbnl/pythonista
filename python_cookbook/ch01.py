Chapter 1

1. Use Python "star expressions" to unpack elements from iterables of arbitrary length.
2. Use `collections.deque` to store the last few items during iteration or during some processing.
3. Use `heapq` to get the list of largest or smallest N items in a collection
4. Use `collections.defaultdict` and initialize the first value so you can focus on adding items.
5. Use `collections.OrderedDict` when creating a dictionary where you can control the order of items when iterating
6. Use `zip` to group items together
7. You can use `key` argument when using `min` and `max` functions
8. Use set operations to find out what two dicts (keys or values) have in common: &, -
9. Use `set` and generators to remove duplicates from a sequence while maintaining order
10. Use `slice` class to avoid mysterious hardcoded indices
11. Use `collections.Counter` class when determining most frequently occuring items in a sequence. You can also use mathematical operations in instances of them
